# Meow · Human · AI 🐱👤🤖

A game where you can chat with other people's cats who are walking on the keyboard.
its like a guessing game where you get 2 minutes or 12 text messages to talk to an anonymous user who can either be a cat, a human or an AI. 
by being a cat means picking cat and let your cat type over your keyboard :3

I've used node.js to host this game, express.js for the server, socket.io for real-time communication, and html, css, and js for the client side interface.

This was made for the YSWS program, (meow)[https://meow.hackclub.com/]
